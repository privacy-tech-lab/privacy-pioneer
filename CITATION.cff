abstract: >-
  Data collection by websites and their integrated third
  parties is often not transparent. We design privacy
  interfaces for the browser to help people understand who
  is collecting which data from them. In a proof of concept
  browser extension, Privacy Pioneer , we implement a
  privacy popup, a privacy history interface, and a
  watchlist to notify people when their data is collected.
  For detecting location data collection, we develop a
  machine learning model based on TinyBERT, which reaches an
  average F1 score of 0.94. We supplement our model with
  deterministic methods to detect trackers, collection of
  personal data, and other monetization techniques. In a
  usability study with 100 participants 82% found Privacy
  Pioneer easy to understand and 90% found it useful
  indicating the value of privacy interfaces directly
  integrated in the browser.
